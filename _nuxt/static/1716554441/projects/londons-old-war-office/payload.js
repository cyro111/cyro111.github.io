Our interior design team has created a captivating and refined space that honours the nuanced history of The Old War Office, which dates to 1906 and has reopened its doors following a six-year transformation. This residence, a testament to our status as a leading luxury apartment designer across London, captures the essence of a contemporary English home, blending the old and the new with a curated mix of contemporary ceramics, classical artworks, and carefully sourced antiques. The design incorporates discreet references to the Middle East and the Far East and summons a sense of quiet grandeur. High ceilings are adorned with intricate mouldings, and a strong connection with nature is fostered through a palette of soft green tones, botanical prints, and natural elements. Key pieces include a hand-turned drinks cabinet and dining table by Alfred Newall, wrought iron side tables by Tyson, and a Whitway chandelier adapted from a 1940s design. Stand-out antiques include a vintage American console table and French neoclassical alabaster table lamps, all seamlessly integrated into the luxurious fabric of this historic space, highlighting our expertise in luxury apartments.",_key:"8e12d9f50d37"}]}]}],_type:s},{columns:[{_type:i,span:{column:t}},{textContent:{_type:u,position:"Bottom"},_type:v,span:{column:6},image:{image:o,alt:"Old war office",size:{width:p,height:b}},video:{}},{span:{column:t},_type:i},{textContent:{position:"Top",_type:u},_type:v,span:{column:20},image:{image:w,alt:"The Old War office",size:{width:x,height:b}},video:{}}],_type:s,border:j,cols:32},{_key:"481c68f29b86",_type:k,content:[{markDefs:[],children:[{marks:[d,e,h],text:l,_key:"e6086858d200",_type:a},{_type:a,marks:[d,e],text:" start ",_key:"950d37174d07"},{_type:a,marks:[d,e,h],text:"of a",_key:"5c20c4c69863"},{_type:a,marks:[d,e],text:" global journey",_key:"2ada040387c4"}],_type:f,style:g,_key:"ddbabfea53ce"}]},{_type:m,slides:[{image:{mobile:{size:{}},image:"image-6b9c3705e1e495812f886025acbdb97f95569726-3266x4252-jpg",alt:c,size:{width:3266,height:b}},video:{}},{video:{},image:{mobile:{size:{}},image:"image-b5c8782255f3f83196dc6ea2f31d1be2de45e2de-3169x4252-jpg",alt:c,size:{width:3169,height:b}}},{video:{},image:{size:{width:3527,height:b},mobile:{size:{}},image:"image-b9136b16abee1d950c434a473025b34a692d5b1f-3527x4252-jpg",alt:c}},{image:{mobile:{size:{}},image:"image-8c1f83b77629dc455eaf8a98691fb4ab538e9352-3187x4252-jpg",alt:c,size:{width:n,height:b}},video:{}},{image:{mobile:{size:{}},image:"image-50a969a6c70f29fa903b8e7754c314c236404e54-3294x4252-jpg",alt:c,size:{width:3294,height:b}},video:{}},{image:{size:{height:b,width:3336},mobile:{size:{}},image:"image-fa3af2e596baa2209650a717f564007f04b77499-3336x4252-jpg",alt:c},video:{}}]}],related:{slug:"dubai-penthouse",name:"Project Dawn",formattedTitle:[{children:[{_key:"b0518147e3de",_type:a,marks:[],text:"Dubai\nPenthouse"}],_type:f,style:g,_key:"991f401cd8fe",markDefs:[]}],location:[{style:g,_key:"27ac6f10702a",markDefs:[],children:[{text:"Dubai\nUnited Arab Emirates",_key:"57d2839ccfd0",_type:a,marks:[]}],_type:f}],title:"Dubai Penthouse"},image:{size:{width:b,height:y},mobile:{size:{width:b,height:y},image:z,alt:c},image:z,alt:c},images:[{image:{image:w,size:{height:b,width:x}},video:{},_type:"featuredImage"}],formattedTitle:[{style:g,_key:"2b8d0fc0d372",markDefs:[],children:[{_type:a,marks:[],text:A,_key:"963f2bbd06e7"}],_type:f}],video:{},seo:{_type:"seo",description:"The walls are painted in a warm ivory hue, providing a backdrop that allows the carefully curated artwork and furnishings to take centre stage.
